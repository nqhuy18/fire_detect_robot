# Autonomous Mobile Robot for 2D Mapping and Early Fire Detection in Supermarkets
## Functions:
- 2D environment mapping
- Path planning for inspection
- Early fire detection (broken wires, smoke, old power outlets, etc.)
- Robot control and monitoring via smartphone

## Branch Structure and Responsibilities

- **main**: Contains the main stable codebase.
- **huy**: Focused on combining sensor data for indoor localization, generating 2D maps, and planning patrol routes.
- **long**: Handles sensor reading, motor control, and designing the mobile app for robot monitoring.
- **hai**: Implements early fire detection, including detecting broken wires, smoke, and aging electrical outlets.
